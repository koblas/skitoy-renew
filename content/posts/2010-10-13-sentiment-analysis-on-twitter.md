Continue to poke away at looking at twitter data and what it means.  One of the things I think about, because everybody else is doing it, is the idea of sentiment analysis.

What&#8217;s interesting is that this posting reminded me of a Facebook &#8220;problem&#8221; &#8212; Sombody posts a note on facebook like &#8220;Broke my arm&#8221; and you end up clicking &#8220;Like&#8221; if you want to follow the conversation around this, but of course you really don&#8217;t like it.  Here&#8217;s an interesting case from the twitter data.

Kristin has of course indicated that this is &#8220;unhappy&#8221;, and her followers have concurred.  In this case I would consider it agreement with the original sentiment, rather than disagreement&#8230;
