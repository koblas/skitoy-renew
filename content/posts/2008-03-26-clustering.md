I&#8217;ve been playing with clustering my email, just a sample set of 300 or so messages.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve done any &#8220;NLP&#8221; work and it&#8217;s really quite fun.

Some learnings:

As the dimentionality of space increases everything starts to sit at the origin:

  * initially you might have 120 unique words in an email message, some of which are repeated multiple times (e.g. &#8220;the&#8221;, &#8220;linkedin&#8221;, &#8230;)
  * but, a second email message might have a different set of 120 words, with an overlap of 40..
  * hang on a second, those 40 words most of them are stop words on words that have an overall corpus frequency that is quite high. 
  * Solutions:&nbsp; Stemming and Eliminating stop words, or more&#8230; 

Two useful papers&#8230;

  * [Using TF-IDF Anomalies to Cluster Documents on Subject Matter][1]
  * [Simultaneous Categorization of Text Documents and Identification of Cluster-dependent Keywords][2]

Totally useful resource for clustering and text categorization:
