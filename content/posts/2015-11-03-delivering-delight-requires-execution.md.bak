I do like delight, I really do.

  I was wondering last night about why saved searches have sucked for so long. Got thinking about some slides I&#8217;m putting together about quality. Part of it is that &#8220;move fast and break things&#8221; is counter productive to where we need to be, we need to move fast, but letting people internalize &#8220;break things&#8221; is part of why I think we&#8217;ve not put the attention into resolving it (aka excellence).

Maybe it&#8217;s &#8212;

***Deliver delight by excellent execution***


If this was SGI, it probably would have been a BINGO (http://www.geometer.org/sgi/wsj.txt) Though that&#8217;s the concept that I think is important. We can&#8217;t delight folks if we&#8217;re not striving for excellence. Excellence alone allows us to focus on the weeds and the not the result &#8211; think about polishing a rock, prettiest rock ever, still a rock.
