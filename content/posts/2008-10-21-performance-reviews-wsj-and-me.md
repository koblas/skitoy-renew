RThe WSJ just did an article about the pointlessness of [performance reviews][1] it&#8217;s interesting to see that the posting I wronge a long time ago about [Performance Reviews.][2] Shared many of the same points:

  * Performance doesn&#8217;t determine pay
  * Objectivity is subjective
  * It disrupts team work

Managers should go coach some kids sports and really understand what teamwork is about&#8230;  It&#8217;s both useful to the community and teaches you many leasons about how to interact with people who might not have the same focus as you.
