Brief bio background &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing email in some way shape or form since my address was:   
&#8230;!uoregon!chemstor!koblas  
or   
&#8230;{ames,decwrl,pyramid,wyse}! mips!koblas

If that means something to you, then you probably have a clue that I&#8217;ve done this for a while.  If it doesn&#8217;t here&#8217;s some other tidbits, I can write a sendmail.cf file from $* rules, and written SMTP servers, managed 200M++ mailboxes for internet companies&#8230;  Mail is in my blood, but at this point it&#8217;s just something that I know, from GUI, Spam and Servers it&#8217;s not a challenge it&#8217;s just an hour here or there to get it working.

**Point**: I get email.

Now what&#8217;s totally funny is that about two years ago I decided to break the mold and really _get_ Facebook, be an engaged social user.   Over the years I&#8217;ve posted status updates, read about who&#8217;s sick, etc., etc.  I don&#8217;t wonder what it&#8217;s for, it&#8217;s part of my life.

**Point**: I&#8217;m a Facebook user.

What&#8217;s interesting is that while I&#8217;ve got an address book with everybody in it, LinkedIn to manage those infrequent contacts, this that the other thing.  I continue to find my self sending more and more messages via Facebook&#8230;  **Why?**

Pocket theory, thanks Ryan for helping with the thinking:  We all have friends, when we want to reach out to them how?  Ok, so I&#8217;ve got three email addresses for you, one of which I&#8217;m 99% sure is no good (it&#8217;s your previous employer).  So, I&#8217;ve got at least two now..  Which one do I send to, which one do you check, do you check any of them&#8230;  This is where Facebook reigns, I know that if I send you a message on Facebook you&#8217;ll get it in at least two places without feeling like I&#8217;m spamming you.

Not only that but since you probably _do_ want to receive messages from Facebook, you&#8217;ve got a good email address registered with them, so I now can totally ignore those &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to change from Comcast to Pacbell and I&#8217;m not clueful enough to change to a free email account&#8221;.  I know I can Facebook you and you&#8217;ll get my message regardless of where you read your email&#8230;

Now if we could only convince Facebook to give a serious rev to the messaging GUI (should have said no to the mgmt job and come in as a geek, but that&#8217;s a story for another day).

ps.  Sometimes I wish I was a writer/editor&#8230;  These thoughts would be better framed.
