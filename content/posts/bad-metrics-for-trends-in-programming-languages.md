Was reading a posting about [Trends in web development according to Google][1] one section got me me thinking.&nbsp; Their trends show end user behavior as it relates to popularity.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I think about language popularity I think in terms of programs written or lines of code produced&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Google trend I think is a misplaced metric.&nbsp; 

Specifically, when I&#8217;m writing various languages I&#8217;ve got these behaviors:

* **PHP** &#8211; I&#8217;m frequently found typing the following query &#8220;php strpos&#8221; or &#8220;php call\_user\_func&#8221;.&nbsp; Basically using &#8220;php&#8221; as a google keyword to get me to man page about the specific php function.&nbsp; It&#8217;s fast and easy.
* **Perl** &#8211; My man page behavior is a bit different.. it&#8217;s &#8220;perldoc -f strpos&#8221;, since perl has all of the documentation built into the system with simple command line tools to bring it forth.
* **Java** &#8211; Very little of java is focused on language issues, its all about the libraries.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to be doing a query like HashMap without the Java qualification.
* **C++** &#8211; Very similar to Java &#8211; you know the language, it&#8217;s queries like &#8220;STL list iterator&#8221; or other library or feature specific bits.&nbsp; Sure, once in a while I might use &#8220;C++ abstract template&#8221; but when you&#8217;re in C++ land usually the word &#8220;template&#8221; and %$(#*(#^ &#8212; that&#8217;s the current g++ error on your screen &#8212; is sufficient to get the right help
* **JavaScript** &#8211; Can&#8217;t really leave it out, it is a language that&#8217;s web search centric and I do qualify my queries with JavaScript to get to the search results, but I&#8217;ve found that this isn&#8217;t very good (the pagerank for the site that has the good info is low)

That&#8217;s it, unless you do an aggregation of all of the sub-search terms I think it&#8217;s premature to use Google Trends as a valid qualification of true language trends.
