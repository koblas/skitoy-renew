Over the years I&#8217;ve had the chance to work with my friend Matt twice &#8212; once at <Excite@Home> (via blue mountain arts) a second time at Yahoo on Mail.&nbsp; He has to be one of the more upbeat people I&#8217;ve worked with through the years, one thing he&#8217;s said so many times that it&#8217;s almost comical (ok, maybe it&#8217;s just me snickering under my breath) is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;How can we delight our users&#8221;

or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s delightful&#8221;

or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s a delightful experience&#8221;

So, now ever time I hear &#8220;&#8230;delight&#8230;user&#8230;&#8221; in a sentence I think of Matt.&nbsp; So, as I was riding in to work this morning I had the following series of thoughts:

  * Delighted users are happy users
  * Happy users are repeat users
  * Repeat users are good customers
  * Good customers bring their friends
  * Making customers happy and their friends happy&#8230;well, &#8216;nuf said

Thank Matt for keeping things delightful &#8212; I&#8217;ll still snicker under my breath.
