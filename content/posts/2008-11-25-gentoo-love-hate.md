I got a new laptop.. Yeah!

Part of the idea of this new laptop is to run a bunch of vmware sessions to do some multi-server development.  Lots of ram, fast CPU&#8230; now the challenge is getting the unix enviornment working.  I&#8217;ve been using gentoo at work for a while &#8212; also on my own personall server &#8212; it&#8217;s nice, but it&#8217;s a totally pain to setup.

**Love:** I can install just about any package and any version.  After spending a few years locked in Fedora and finding that I was constantly upgrading a package here and there, but the dependencies and other things constantly drove me up the wall.

**Love:** It&#8217;s linux &#8212; unix, etc.  It&#8217;s home.

**Hate:** The challenge is that you need to upgrade things about every six months just to make sure you&#8217;ve not drifted too far off the reservation (e.g. forcing a full install).

**Hate:** The installation isn&#8217;t quick and easy, you have to read a wiki and make lots of little configurations.
