Gosh it&#8217;s nice to have a job that doesn&#8217;t require writing performance reviews, but I still have friends who encounter them on a regular basis.&nbsp; This is a problem sort of like taxes and in desperate need of reform.&nbsp; The original idea was some what sound, though you might argue it was tied to bureaucracy &#8212; the requirement that you needed to justify why X got a 8% raise and you only got a 5% raise.&nbsp; 

What we all know is that performance reviews and raises are fundamentally disconnected, typically done in a revisionist history that causes the performance review to be written to match the raise that was already in progress.

So, how to fix it&#8230;&nbsp; 

  * **Everybody gets a basic raise of X%** &#8211; why not
  * Make sure you reserve a pool of $$ and give top performers Y%

Wait, that&#8217;s not new&#8230; It&#8217;s the data collection that&#8217;s new, not the money.

**First Step** &#8211; Instead of the onerious process of doing these huge formal performance reviews, which require at least a day of training to even fill out.&nbsp; Go back to school and have a simple 10 question form, with a rating from 1..5&nbsp; and give that to employees on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; 

Pro

  * Forces a regular feedback cycle with your employees
  * Should be able to be done in 5 minutes for each employee

Con 

  * Now it&#8217;s quarterly
  * No written feedback
  * Managers who give everybody an A+ or employees who expect it

**Second Step** &#8211; 360 degree feedback &#8211; via prediction markets.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Ok, instead of again foisting an annual review process on people (ok, co-workers).&nbsp; Set up a system that randomly polls your co-workers (or customers) about your performance.&nbsp; Ask them 5 questions again on a 1..5 scale.&nbsp; Sample questions:

  * Is John making his commitments?
  * Has John helped you get your job done regularly?
  * Is John activly participating in design discussions?
  * Is John spending too much time surfing the internet?
  * Is John polite with customers on the phone?

Random things, maybe some organizational focused questions (sales vs. programmer).&nbsp; The core of the idea is that by polling your co-workers frequently you can see trends over time.

Pro

  * Regular polling of your co-workers, yields consistent data.
  * Simple and quick&#8230;&nbsp; no lengthy written docs
  * Anonymous and random

Con

  * Co-workers who always answer &#8220;5&#8221; he&#8217;s the best
  * Lack of participation

**Final Thought &#8211;** Now you&#8217;ve got a system in place that lowers the burden of long paperwork, provides regular feedback and some real metrics on which you can base the who gets the bounce $$$ or the promotion.&nbsp; This reduces the ability of a manager to make &#8220;perception&#8221; based arguments.&nbsp; Plus, it provides regular feedback cycles both the employee and the manager on your performance (how do people perceive (polls) me and how am I perceived from above (report cards))
