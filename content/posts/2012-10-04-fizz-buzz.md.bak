As seen on a thread on [Hacker News][1] about Fizz Buzz and &#8220;interesting&#8221; functional ways to solve it.  Realized that there are many ways to boil the ocean, but this feels like a nice compromise between data/program separation and language.

_Note this is using a &#8220;Bazz&#8221; variant of the FizzBuzz problem where Bazz is printed every 7 numbers._

```python
cases = [(3, "Fizz"), (5, "Buzz"), (7, "Bazz")]

for i in range(110):
    pr = ''.join([s * (i % m == 0) for m, s in cases])
    print pr or i
```
