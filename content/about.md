I depend on blogs to get my work done, from odd syntax issue to deeper understanding
of specific problem domains. This little slice here is to help others if I can give
back a little bit.

My background in a nutshell:

- Created the SOCKS protocol which is an RFC standard
- Wrote paint programs and wordprocessors for X Windows
- Have run the engienering teams at multiple startups
- Enjoy programming for the fun of it
- Never stop learning
