We all can cite many open source and even some &#8220;closed&#8221; source projects that we use and interact with daily.  How did they start?  Most of them started out of the passions of a single individual, but how did that spread?  How did people find out about the projects, how did others start building on these projects?

I ask, because I&#8217;ve just put out my CMS for Google App Engine (it&#8217;s pre-alpha) and looking for people who are interested in playing with it, giving me feedback, helping it improve.    The challenge is out side of nagging on my friends &#8212; amost feels like nagging on them to change jobs &#8212; I&#8217;m uncertain where to start.

I&#8217;m going to continue plugging away, but if anybody know how to evangelise or create community that would help.

For those interested (please) the project is here:
