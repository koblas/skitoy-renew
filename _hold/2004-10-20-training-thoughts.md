Training, now this is a whole long subject unto itself&#8230; The simple key points for adventure racing or anything comes down to three points:

* Consistency &#8211; get out and do something aerobic 3..5 days a week
* Patience &#8211; realize that it takes months (years) to improve
* Pleasure &#8211; if you&#8217;re not enjoying the activity, you won&#8217;t keep going

Most of the races I do are more to provide focus rather then ends. The adventure race that Pat, Julie and I do is more just to have a fun afternoon doing something physical. In my case, I don&#8217;t get my pleasure from the day-to-day grind of training, but more from the people I&#8217;m training with. I usually run with Julie (or other people I know) and bike with a different group. Sometimes the workouts are focused, sometimes they are just chatty&#8230; Though we all are not the same speed, but we&#8217;re suffering together&#8230;

Realize that the sport(s) you might be interested in, can easily be supported by other day-to-day training&#8230; Simple ideas of things to think about:

Aerobic fitness &#8212; 

* Bicycling
* Running
* Swimming
* XC Skiing
* [all of those gym machines as well]

Strength/Balance &#8212;

* Rock Climbing
* Yoga &#8211; hatha/astanga
* Gymnastics

It&#8217;s worthwhile to poke around and see if there is any organized activies in the area, everything from masters swimming to a pack of friends who all like to do XYZ.
