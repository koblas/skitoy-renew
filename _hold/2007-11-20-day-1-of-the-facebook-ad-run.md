GoogleBot is still lame .. ok, maybe Google employees are totally insensitive to advertising.&#160; Stats from the last 24 hours:

783 impressions &#8212; remember it&#8217;s running targeted at "Company: Google"   
0 clicks   
$0.20 CPC offered

I&#8217;m going to change it to a $0.55 per click and see if the impressions go up any.. probably every is going home for the holidays.
