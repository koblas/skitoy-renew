Well, it looks increasing they CPC rate to $0.55 has improved the impressions.&#160; I&#8217;ve logged an additional 1,200 impressions in the last day.&#160; I&#8217;ve also now gotten 12 clicks (up from 800 impressions an 0 clicks yesterday).&#160; This now is showing a total over the run of a 0.73% CTR.

The good part is that I&#8217;ve also picked up an additional 100 views of the page, so hopefully this means that somebody is passing it around at Google to look into the problems at wink.
