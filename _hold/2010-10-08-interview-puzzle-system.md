Just finished the &#8220;greplin challenge&#8221; ( http://challenge.greplin.com/ ).  Sure it was a good distraction, but it has gotten me thinking about idea #79 for a weekend project.  Build a system that hosts Programming Challenge questions for companies, has a basic interface for validation of inputs/outputs and submits results.

Users register &#8212; have score boards of completed questions, etc, etc.

Companies can &#8212; review canidates, potentially see what other problems they&#8217;ve solved (right answer on the Company Q challenge)&#8230;   Oooh valuable&#8230;

Growth opportunities, maybe some quizes like elance to rate your skills.

Anything else?  Thrift server as the basis of the API for some challenge questions.
