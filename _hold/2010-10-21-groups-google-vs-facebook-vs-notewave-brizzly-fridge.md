Small rant attached &#8211; though it&#8217;s over groups which I&#8217;ve been thinking about for years

Facebook groups launched a short while ago, I&#8217;ve been using Google Groups for ages (along with Y!Groups).  [Brizzly][1] launced their groups product (though they didn&#8217;t call it groups) [TheFridge][2] has their view and [Notewave][3] (my own weekend project) has it&#8217;s view.  Groups is a necessary space, so much so there are fields of &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; startups doing it around pictures, sports teams, etc, etc.

Fundamentally I want Facebook to win &#8212; ok not really, but yes I do.  I wouldn&#8217;t mind if Google would give them a run for the money, but they appear to be going backwards.  I just received an email that says &#8220;were&#8217; removing features from Groups &#8212; use other services&#8221;.  This **really sucks** google.

Long ago when I was at Yahoo I wanted to re-work groups, since the phylosophy was for groups of more than 500 people it didn&#8217;t work for &#8220;small&#8221; groups effectively, some ways Google didn&#8217;t either &#8212; but it was a trade off&#8230;

Here&#8217;s my necessary feature list, comparison matrix:


Feature                     | Yahoo       | Google      | Facebook    | Notewave/Brizzly/Fridge
----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------
Mailing list                | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         | Yes
Calendar                    | Yes         | No          | No          | No
Events                      | Sort of     | No          | Yes         | No
Shared Docs                 | No          | Going Away  | Yes         | No
Photos as 1st class         | No          | No          | Yes         | Yes
Privacy                     | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         | Yes
Able to invite non-friends  | by email    | by email    | No          | by email
Public Facing               | Yes         | Yes         | Yes         | No

What most services fail to realize is that if they can nail groups of 20 people (soccer team, etc.) That they will become more much indispensable to people, sure I need groups for lots of anonymous people on the Internet (I&#8217;m a member of too many), but if you think that&#8217;s the core businss of groups you&#8217;ve missed one primary use case **everybody** has (their Friends/Associates). I&#8217;m not friends with my soccer team parents, but I want a group with them in it (Facebook fail).

Facebook &#8212; If you can fix a few little issues with groups you will rule my world:

  * Have a calendar &#8212; sync it via iCal to my phone/google
  * Allow me to invite people via email address

That&#8217;s it, then I&#8217;m yours&#8230; Don&#8217;t get caught up in &#8220;Databases&#8221;, &#8220;Poll&#8221; or other crufty features.
