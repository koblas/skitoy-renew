The good part about writing everything in a simple language, it that it makes iterative programming easy&#8230;&nbsp; Time to fix and other such fun issues would be a pain in the but if I was doing all of my Clustering 101 development work in C++, though it might reduce the run time down.

That said, finally got a full run in last night, took 5 hours &#8212; ah the joys of sleep &#8212; and discovered that I&#8217;d accomplished &#8230; something!&nbsp; Oh, but wait everything was high frequency terms, no real surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, that I&#8217;ve got a working system, it time to really focus in on making meaningful token vectors as the inputs.

For your enjoyment, here&#8217;s some of the cluster leaders:

  * we, have, about
  * as, was, but
  * use, how, your
  * their, are, can
  * are, google, your
  * video, game, can
  * we, our, as
  * as, an, about
  * are, as, will
  * new, has, company
  * nbsp, are, have&nbsp; [hmm&#8230; my de-HTMLing has a bug]
