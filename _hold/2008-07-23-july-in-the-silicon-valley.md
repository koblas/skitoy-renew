Can&#8217;t be just the high price of gas!&nbsp; It&#8217;s Wednesday and there very little traffic and a pleasant 70 degress outside!&nbsp; Track was a blast yesterday and not only did I run well (quite a few 75second 400&#8217;s) but I&#8217;m not sore today and &#8230;

&nbsp;

IT&#8217;S A NICE DAY!
