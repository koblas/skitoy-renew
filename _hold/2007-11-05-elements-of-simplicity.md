Just book marking [Elements of Simplicity][1] have to think about this for a few minutes.. Funny how the trailing slide is a 2x2 matrix turn 45' to make it a "diamond".

The Grid is:

> Cost --- [lower ... higher]
> 
> Benefit --- [ lower ... higher]

Giving these key points:

* 0,0 --- frustration (low benefit, high cost)
* 0,1 --- contentment (high benefit, high cost)
* 1,0 --- concession (low cost, low benefit)
* 1,1 --- delight (low cost, high benefit)
* 0.5, 0.5 --- satisfaction

Of course there were 6 elements:

* Time
* Money
* Physical Effort
* Brain Cycles
* Social Deviance
* Non-Routine [we like routine]

Thinking about this and my Xside ideas&#8230;&#xA0; maybe life in general.
