Once again an article pointing out that creativity is not about monetary reward, but about passion.

> Engineers in jeans create prototypes of Raytheon&#8217;s most revolutionary ideas in quarters about as impressive as a high-school science lab. The Bike Shop employs a corps of 15 handpicked scientists and engineers striving to bring advanced concepts to life &#8212; and to market &#8212; as quickly as possible. For its models, employees buy components off the shelf from stores such as Home Depot rather than order from big defense suppliers. As important as the inventions themselves, the goal is to help inspire a more creative environment at Raytheon. &#8220;We have more fun than is generally allowed on company time,&#8221; says James Small, the team&#8217;s chief and a former university physics professor.
