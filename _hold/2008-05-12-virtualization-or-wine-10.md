Just to etch some thoughts into the ether&#8230; 

Was having a discussion with a friend over mother day breakfast.&nbsp; He was talking about how he had three different virutal machines installed on his system and was drifting off onto subject of unbuntu&#8217;s compatibility with hadoop, etc.etc.&nbsp; Somewhere in this discussion he was griping about how with a virtual machine he didn&#8217;t have any battery life left, since they really never stopped running.

To me this isn&#8217;t really the point, it&#8217;s not about if your OS is MacOS, Linux or Windows it&#8217;s all about the applications.&nbsp; I care about if my document is online or on my desktop, but do I really care about what my OS is?&nbsp; No!

When a user goes and buys a machine they aren&#8217;t really worrying about Intel vs. AMD.&nbsp; They&#8217;re evening getting to the point where they&#8217;re less sensitive to MacOS vs. Windows (Linux is the outlier).&nbsp; It always has been about &#8220;Can I run application X&#8221;.&nbsp; 

The point I made over the weekend was that with systems like WINE the OS isn&#8217;t as important anymore.&nbsp; I can run Office (since StarOffice sucks) on my Linux box or (someday my Mac) and not &#8220;worry&#8221; about what the OS does or doesn&#8217;t do.
