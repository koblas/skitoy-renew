Long story made short, was curious about the open source Digg clone&#8230; Downloaded Plugg.

There was a small bug in DB permissions that was causing it not to install correctly, so I cracked open the source.&nbsp; OMG!&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been dealing with OO PHP for long enough that what I found reminded me why I do have standards over the code that is produced.

It&#8217;s not just bad, it&#8217;s..it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; **PHP is clearly the new Basic**.

sigh
