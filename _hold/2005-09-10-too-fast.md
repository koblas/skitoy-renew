Ok... So the training program said: 18 miles @ PMP + 45-60 seconds. I knew I was going too fast, but when I got to 9 miles and saw that I was averaging a bit too fast, the goal got revised to make the first 9 and second 9 equal. All in all it was a good run, but ended up running 18m @ PMP + 25 seconds.

Legs are tired, but feel good otherwise. Ate well, though probably should have drank a bit more. It was nice to see that my heart rate was sitting around 147 for the last miles (or 79% of MHR).
