I bike&#8230; I bike more than average... While a [Poseur Jersey][1] would be fun, I was thinking on my ride to work today that a shirt/jersey that said (primarily on my ride to work):

> The more I bike
>
> The less gas I use
>
> The more there is
>
> The cheaper it is
>
> The happier you are

Maybe then a few cars would be a bit more considerate.
