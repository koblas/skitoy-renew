After giving a few days for the hype to cool down &#8212; not the hype around Dark Knight &#8212; but around [Google Knol][1].&nbsp; I think I understand the business and the opportunity and the shortcomings.

In the press, they keep on equating Knol with Wikipedia, which is totally inaccurate:

  * [TechCrunch: Google Launches Knol, The Monetizable Wikipedia][2]  
    Each article is created by a team of authors who receive attribution, and are allowed to take part in a rev-share for AdSense ads on their page.
  * [Google Knol Opens Its Doors, Challenges Wikipedia][3]  
    Any topic can have several knols written on it, so the featured knol is based on your credentials and the authority of the article.

I personally think the comparison to Wikipedia is inaccurate, it&#8217;s really all about croud sourcing about.com.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s do a quick comparison:


&nbsp;                  | about.com       | wikipedia   | google knol
------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------
user contributed        | only editors    | yes         | yes
personal profit         | yes             | no          | yes
easy to create          | no              | wiki-cabal  | yes
any subject             | yes             | no          | yes
SEO easy                | yes             | yes         | yes
multiple similar docs   | yes             | no          | yes
authority               | yes             | maybe       | no


The biggest win of knol is the ability for people to create any arbitrary page about any subject &#8212; which you can&#8217;t really do in wikipedia (this isn&#8217;t a valid wikipedia page:&nbsp; [Learning to Ski][4] &#8212; not really about a thing).&nbsp; While it&#8217;s a rich topic area for about.com or for personal blogs, the addtion to knol makes it something where anybody can create a meaninful document.&nbsp; The downside is that if \_you\_ disagree with the [Learning to Ski][4] page, you have two choices:

  * Contribute your edits back 
  * Create your own page

Now this is where the fun begins.&nbsp; Wikipedia promotes a model by having no personal gain to foster a community of people who create documents and improve documents.&nbsp; While Google Knol creates a disincentive to create better documents, while it&#8217;s possible to set up a document as a collaborative entity, if there&#8217;s ad revenue associated with a document, an above average user would be better served by creating a new document and fracturing the market to gain in $$.&nbsp; 

The biggest problem is that right now google knol is being dominated by &#8220;doctors&#8221; creating pages on medical conditions for personal a gain.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still unclear if as this product matures that it&#8217;ll be a collaborate enviornment or a morass of pages and dis-connected content.&nbsp; Sure, there&#8217;s some star ratings to indicate the credibility of the document or author, but will this fundamentally influence the SEO bits on the page.
