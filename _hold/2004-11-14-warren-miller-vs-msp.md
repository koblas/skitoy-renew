The more I watch Warren Miller ski films the more I realize that it's pure pluggage. We went to see Impact on Saturday and walked out realizing that there is now once again less snowboarding than skiing, but gosh I really need a Jeep, helicopter and three killer ski buddies to ski... Oh, wait a minute, skiing is **fun** and I don't need to travel to remote parts of the world just to enjoy an afternoon.

Well at least until I can give it all up and be a bum in jackson hole...
