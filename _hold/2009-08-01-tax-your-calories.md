Just a random idea that came out of a strange hallway conversation on the cost of health care. Here&#8217;s the idea of the week.

One of the current big problems in America is the over consumption of food yielding both health problems and just waste. Since we&#8217;re currently trying to figure out how to pay for our healthcare system the quick idea is to tax calories in the style of other sin taxes. Think of it this way, a typical person consumes 2000 calories a day, if there was a sin tax of $0.20 (e.g 1 cent per 100 calories) it would be a small price to pay. The quick observation is that if you&#8217;re eating a Bacon Double Cheeseburger with fries and a large coke you&#8217;re probably just at a 2000 calorie lunch. So now when you eat breakfast and dinner you&#8217;re clearly contributing to your long term health care plan&#8230; that emergency room visit for a coronary bypass.

The quick modification is that there really should be no tax on any fresh or frozen produce. If you really were eating half of your calories in produce clearly your health care costs are going to be lower, than Mr. Bacon Dbl Cheeseburger.
