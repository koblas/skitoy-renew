Ok, took a few minutes to play with the demo site for RadiantCMS... It depends on having functional tags to deliver functionality <r:loop> ... gack... Not another programming language in tags.

Also played with SocialText, so close... But really want something thats right between CMS and Wiki (+ blog)...
