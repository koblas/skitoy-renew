As most of us know there is that (Y!) branding at the bottom of your iPhone Weather app.  What&#8217;s funny is that fundamentally this is eroding the brand value of Yahoo!

The other day pulled up the weather on my phone, saw the forecast and said flatly &#8220;_That&#8217;s is not the weather for today&#8221;._  So, the (Y!) branded experience says that you do not provide correct or accurate information.  Think about this for a minute, the next time I need weather, or any other piece of information I personally am going to dis-trust Yahoo! and look for a better information provider.

Wait &#8211; now why don&#8217;t I hold Apple to the same standard, it is an iPhone after all.   Apple has done a good job of distancing themselves from the contents of the app, or the quality of the network, and the cool factor of the device itself.  Now all I want is the ability to remove the Yahoo! Weather app and replace it with my &#8220;vendor X&#8221; weather app which I trust.
