Not technology startups, but human startups (aka small business).&nbsp; At one level you can look around the Silicon Valley and see strip malls full of stores, but if you look closely you&#8217;ll see that there is very little variety.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s two examples:

  * Furniture
  * Outdoor Gear

In the furniture case, there is almost no variety of stores in the area.&nbsp; You either have Ikea, Ethan Allen, or some other chain retailer or you have a strip mall store that&#8217;s importing some low cost furniture from the pacific rim (almost all of these stores have the same selection).&nbsp;&nbsp; What we don&#8217;t have is any mid-range dealers, who have broad selection.&nbsp; What&#8217;s different is that when I&#8217;m in Reno there are at least a dozen furniture stores that have a variety of choices (from pacific rim to high end).&nbsp; How can a city of about 200,000 people have better choices than an area of 5M?

Some insight might be gained by looking at outdoor gear, another speciality area.&nbsp; Here I can name the stores in the area off the top of my head:

  * REI
  * Mel Cotton&#8217;s
  * Sports Basement
  * Sun Valley Ski & Patio
  * Any Mountain

If you&#8217;ve been paying attention I&#8217;ve been looking for some Ski gear in July, which means that outside of being impossible, it&#8217;s almost pointless to go shopping locally.&nbsp; However, in talking with people at work about the problem I did make the following observation, which is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Reno have more independent retailers of outdoor & ski gear than the Silicon Valley?

The two theories come to mind:

  * Cost of Labor
  * Cost of Land

Most non-box retailer operate on fairly small margins, so the ability to find and maintain a staff who has some expertise in the goods that you&#8217;re selling is going to be very difficult if the cost of labor is high.&nbsp; In theory in Reno you can make a living working at a sporting goods store or a furniture store.&nbsp; However in the Silicon Valley that&#8217;s impossible!&nbsp; So, not only are you now faced with hiring sub-standard help (think Fry&#8217;s) which really doesn&#8217;t serve your customers well.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll also be faced with the double whammy that the cost of land (rent is ~$2-$3 /sqft) is so high that you&#8217;re unable to pay a premium for better talent.&nbsp; Thus you end up in a vicious cycle where you&#8217;ve got low margins, high cost of labor and land and as soon as a week month or two come by, you&#8217;re dead.

The inability of the Silicon Valley to create a true diverse startup culture, limited to high margin ideas is a true cost.&nbsp; We tinker but don&#8217;t foster tinkers.
