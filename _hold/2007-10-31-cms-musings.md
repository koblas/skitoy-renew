While getting the ReCaptcha stuff to work was taking a look at available plugins&#8230; Came across this cool posting about [useless CMSs][1].&nbsp; Which I totally agree with!&nbsp; It&#8217;s of course references docs from back in 2004&#8230;

Still thinking about the core premise of this:

* Object Oriented &#8212; ok I&#8217;m a geek &#8212; Zend Framework and some good thoughts&#8230;
* Easily Styled &#8212; WordPress has shown how users will devote time to presentation.
* Plugins for Authentication &#8212; why not it&#8217;s CMS &#8212; I&#8217;m not the authority on user manement.
* Easy content editing &#8212; have been now playing with Windows Live Writer &#8212; it&#8217;s the easy way to enter content&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or at least shows how desktop apps and web sites can easily integrate.
* Document Managment &#8212; Why does wordpress make a distinction between "Page" and "Post" &#8212; they&#8217;re really the same. 
  * Also needed is document type 
      * Todo List
      * Calendar
      * etc.
* Files (attachments) should be attached to any post (re-used if needed).
* partials, snippets &#8212; content blobs that can be attached anywhere&#8230;&nbsp; Think plugin.

Let&#8217;s think about this for a second, documents need to be accessed via three mechanisms:

* Time Order &#8212; blog style [recent changes or recent published]
* Heirarcy &#8212; section/article/page or whatever &#8230; breadcrumbs&#8230;
* Cloud &#8212; tags, similarity, category, etc.

Most of the time I just want to tag an article and have it added to a cloud&#8230;

It shouldn&#8217;t stop presentation like:
