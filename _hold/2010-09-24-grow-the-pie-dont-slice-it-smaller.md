If you&#8217;ve hung around me long enough you&#8217;ve probably heard me say, grow the pie&#8230;  Of course probably you&#8217;ve wondered what in the world I&#8217;m talking about.  The basic premise is that if you have a business don&#8217;t keep on slicing the market smaller and smaller.  The real goal of a business is to grow the marketplace.

Simple example&#8230;  My random website project of the week&#8230;

I&#8217;ve had a site parked for a long time generating $ $, but wanted to throw a new &#8220;idea&#8221; at the world.  The challenge is that the new idea will of course cannibalize all of the $$ until it get&#8217;s big enough to be useful.  So, realizing that 90% of the traffic to the domain is coming for a foreign country, I&#8217;ve now created a &#8220;local&#8221; experience where the old traffic is getting the same experience and the traffic to the audience that I understand is getting the new experience.  This is effectively growing the pie, I&#8217;ve got everything I used to have plus everything that is new.
