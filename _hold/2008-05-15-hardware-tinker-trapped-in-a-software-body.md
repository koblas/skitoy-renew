I admit it, I&#8217;m a software engineer.&nbsp; I do have occasional aspirations to be other things, graphic designer, product manager, or yesterday hardware engineer.&nbsp; In the course of the day had to different but slightly similar hardware product ideas:

#### **WiFi Picture Frame**

The do exist, but not quite what I want, very simple requirements:

  * WiFi connected to flickr, picassa, shutterfly, gallery or any other photo service
  * With either an RSS feed or other &#8220;fetch&#8221; system you can have your photos show up

That&#8217;s it&#8230; Now you can upload your photos to their normal sharing/printing/etc. site and have them show up at work or over the mantel in &#8220;minutes&#8221;.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t have to tote around an SD card, don&#8217;t have to have a media sharing service.

#### **ProCapture**

Working with my U10G Soccer team yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; The objective of practice was &#8220;power kicks&#8221;, so in addition to a bunch of words and balls I took my camera to practice for some direct feedback.&nbsp; I can get 5 fps from my camera, nice.. but demonstrated the need for a dedicated product.

  * 7in diagonal screen &#8211; OLED if possible (for use in sunny conditions), though standard LCD is probably the norm for the moment
  * Video capture and compression store to SD card &#8212; you could probably get away with a cell phone CCD and compression

Why is it different, it&#8217;s the screen!&nbsp; The idea is that while you&#8217;re out with your soccer team, ski team, golf pro, tennis pro they can quickly video &#8220;tape&#8221; your actions and then show them back to you.&nbsp; On a screen that is easy to see, the two problems that I had with my camera were:

  * 5fps doesn&#8217;t quite cut it &#8212; 30 fps would have gotten all of the detail&#8230; though for golf/tennis you might want 60/120 fps&#8230; 
  * &#8220;viewfinder screen&#8221; isn&#8217;t really effective for review

I&#8217;m sure somebody who&#8217;s a hardware hack could build it for under $1000 as a prototype&#8230;&nbsp; Easily retail for < $300 .. market is just about ever &#8220;pro&#8221; and &#8220;pro-shop&#8221; who wants to add value to their services&#8230; No need to tape, go back to the bar and review, just shoot and go.
