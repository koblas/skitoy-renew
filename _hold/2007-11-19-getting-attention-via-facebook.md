## Background:

Wink has had no end of problems with Google.&#160; It roots back to our book marking service which was overwhelmed with spammers.&#160; At one point I estimated that 75% of our new user registrations were link farm spammers.&#160; Over many months I&#8217;ve cracked down on these abuses and with the re-launch of our service they should be a distant memory.&#160; _Reality check, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re there, but just not productive anymore_.&#160; 

We the re-launch of wink.com I was hoping that we&#8217;d get "re-discovered" by Google and indexed.&#160; Not happening, for that matter they&#8217;re indexing pages around 200 a day (compared to 2000 a day by Yahoo!), we only have [nine pages in the google index][1].&#160; Really thinking about it, they&#8217;ve only indexed the "about" section, not the developer section which is pretty much the same (text content).&#160; 

## Experiment:

In total frustration, I&#8217;ve gone a placed a Facebook ad targeted at Google employees.&#160; It&#8217;s pretty simple, basic units &#8212; $10 budget with a $0.10 CPC&#8230; The subject of the ad is "GoogleBot is lame" in an attempt to get some eyeball share from Google employees.&#160; According to the Facebook ad system, this should target about 5,000 people.&#160; 

## What&#8217;s lacking:

I&#8217;m not a copy writer, so "GoogleBot is lame" is really a lame headline, should it carry more punch.&#160; Should it do other things?&#160;
