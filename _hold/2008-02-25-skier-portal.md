Web site idea for the week.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is based on seeing the following sites:

  * [EpicSki][1] &#8211; Forums and forums
  * [SkiNow][2] &#8211; One mans view of teaching
  * [PSIA][3] &#8211; it&#8217;s all about stepping stones
  * [Ski Resorts Guide][4] &#8211; a whole site for resorts&#8230;

Drives me crazy&#8230;&nbsp; I want a site (wiki) that has:

  * Technical information

  * PSIA teaching information &#8212; why not&#8230;

  * Games to play with kids
  * Video analysis
  * How to teach somebody

  * Tuning information
  * Racing information
  * Park & Pipe tricks like [VideoJug][5]
  * Resort information
  * Instructor recommendations and ratings
  * Village reviews
  * Tips, pointers and other info

  * Don&#8217;t really care about the forums like epic ski, since not much can replace that
  * Probably skip some of the gear guides, since fundamentally the shopping world really is working that
That&#8217;s the quick thought&#8230;
