It&#8217;s an old reminder&#8230;&nbsp; said many ways:

  * Swing for the fences
  * Go big or go home&nbsp; 
  * Can&#8217;t see the forest through the trees
  * etc.

All came from a short discussion last night about the state of the world.&nbsp; Where we have spent lots of time fighting lots of little fires as opposed to working on a single agenda.&nbsp; Thus when you take the combined efforts they&#8217;ve only made it to first base, no home runs or line drives to center field.

**It&#8217;s better to burn out than fade away!**
