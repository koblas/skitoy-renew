Found this on a old blog that I&#8217;m decommissioning &#8212; insight from an old WSJ article.

  * **Tip 1:** Don’t slap your name on just anything to make a buck. 
  * **Tip 2:** Find weaknesses with existing products and fix them. The you can charge more. 
  * **Tip 3:** But raise prices cautiously; make consumers feel they got more than expected and don’t hide company inefficiencies behind price hikes. 
  * **Tip 4:** Seek new consumer bases, and design for them. 
  * **Tip 5:** Invest in products that consumers will always need.
