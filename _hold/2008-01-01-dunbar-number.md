A great case of if you&#8217;re not aware of a space, you don&#8217;t know enough to ask the question.&nbsp; It&#8217;s of course a case where YES somebody has already done a lot of work and research to determine a whole bunch of details about social relationships but here&#8217;s it in a simple thought&#8230;

[150 .. that&#8217;s it, the magic number][1].. Andrew does a good job of relating the Dunbar Number to social networks

Reminds me of the idea of why Y!Groups (and G!Groups) are bad for most personal relationships.
