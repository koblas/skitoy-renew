The learning curve on chef is a lot steeper than I wish.

Can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve got it running like I would.

But, I can now provision a devbox on AWS in 5 minutes with basic packages and users in a sane state.

It took 2 days of fiddling.

Now back to developing systems onto of basic environments.

Things left to learn &#8211;

* How to get private keys onto the machine so git integration is smooth
* How to checkout private repos with chef onto the boxes
* The big challenge is how to &#8220;auto&#8221; configure an environments with AWS Elastic IPs or other tidbits.
