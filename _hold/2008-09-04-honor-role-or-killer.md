I was driving down the road the other day and saw this bumper sticker on a car&#8230;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all see &#8220;Proud Parent of a XYZ School Honor Role&#8221; bumper stickers.&nbsp; This was the first time that I saw a bumper sticker that somebody was proud that their child was a professional killer.

While fundamentally I understand there is a need, is this the right message to be sending to the world?&nbsp; Should we rant against Hollywood for glorification of killing, we&#8217;ll leave Grant Theft Auto out of the picture?
