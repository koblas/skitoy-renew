Thoughts...

* [Kettler Ergoracer][1] - $1600 
* [Lemond Revmaster][2] - $1000 - craigslist $600
* [Daum Ergo 8i][3] 

**Update:** Bought the Revmaster from craiglists (used) for $500, has been very useful during the winter months, use it from time to time this spring when I've only had a short ~30 minute window to get a ride in&#8230; Easy &#8220;quality&#8221;.
