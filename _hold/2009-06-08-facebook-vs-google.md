Had a great discussion this morning with a co-worker.  The crux of the conversation is Google vs. Facebook &#8212; who is going to win. Is Google Wave the game changer that will kill facebook?

Nope.  We&#8217;ve really created three different product spaces in these organizations.  We&#8217;ve got Google which is &#8220;defined&#8221; as an applications company (gmail, docs, apps, etc.) and facebook which is social.

Can Google beat Facebook or Facebook beat Google &#8212; probably not &#8212; I don&#8217;t quite see how my &#8220;who&#8217;s got prettier eyes&#8221;  news feed item has any meaning on my &#8220;apps&#8221; page on iGoogle.  Sure, in a tab, etc, etc.  But, at the same time should facebook be a news feed, platform, or ???  Fundamentally, I don&#8217;t see why facebook isn&#8217;t pushing it&#8217;s platform harder and harder than Google.   It would be nice to see _every_ site offer a login with facebook, let me move my data my personality around the web.  Make my friends part of my web experience, cut down on the &#8220;do you want to give permission&#8221; gunk.  Go for two-tier access &#8212; anonymous FB vs. logged in FB.

That way when I click on the &#8220;who&#8217;s eyes are these&#8221; trivial quiz, I can participate without sharing all of my data, but then they can impose the &#8220;join&#8221; functionality when I feel like it.

Side note &#8212; the funny part is that facebook is great for accepted bi-directional friendship, but twitter proves there&#8217;s a solid marketplace for uni-directional friendship.  Which is handled &#8212; weakly &#8212; by &#8220;fan&#8221; pages on Facebook.   It&#8217;s probably a topic unto itself to discuss how business can utilize Twitter/Facebook to market their &#8220;fan&#8221; tendancies to deliver new customers.
