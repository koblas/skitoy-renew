Our cul-de-sac has a halloween tradition of building a fire and having a potluck at the end of the street.  It&#8217;s a great place to catch up with the happenings in the neighborhood and chatting about all sorts of topics.

One of the topics that came up was the recent acqusition of [Our cul-de-sac has a halloween tradition of building a fire and having a potluck at the end of the street.  It&#8217;s a great place to catch up with the happenings in the neighborhood and chatting about all sorts of topics.

One of the topics that came up was the recent acqusition of][1] and which got onto the topic of software development practices between SV and LA.  Which is an interesting topic, I&#8217;ve been struggeling with the results of the merger for the last six weeks (PR was way late on this topic).   What help me focus my thinking was a combination of observations and a recent [American Masters PBS series on Warner Brothers][2].   In the PBS series two things struck me:

  * Terry Semel sounds like a nice guy during an interview
  * Somebody made the comment that _nobody_ at WB was creative (or something to that effect), it was the director.

What does that have to do with SV vs. LA &#8212; Simple.

LA Software development is based on the studio system:

  * Single person driving a vision
  
    Think directors vision for a film, somebody provides financing and they hire worker bees to do it.
  * Collaboration is not supported
  
    You&#8217;re a worker bee &#8212; you might be a great cinematographer &#8212; but don&#8217;t tell me how to edit a film.

SV is a research vision:

  * Team driving a vision
  
    Classic line is from the VC community &#8212; we don&#8217;t fund ideas we fund teams.
  * Collaboration/conflict is a way of driving to better ideas
  
    Hallway conversations and communications are cited as the source of good products (think Lunch 2.0 &#8212; foo camp etc.)

Can you build good products with either, sure.  Reunion.com claims to have $55m in revenue &#8212; way cool!  But, when you start talking about how to build a good consumer experience you end up in this world &#8220;it&#8217;s the way it is, so shut up and do your job&#8221; (think over compartmentization).

The one thing I&#8217;ve realized is that individuals are the most creative people when given the chance &#8212; look at YouTube &#8212; companies, products, and services should all focus on tapping that market to be successful.

Terry Semel / Yahoo note &#8212;&#8211;

What&#8217;s the difference between Yahoo and Google &#8212; Yahoo was founded on the research principal and drifted to the studio model and somewhere in between it lost a single operating model.  So, what&#8217;s left is a company that&#8217;s stuck in meetings and consensus building, not kicking butt.  If there isn&#8217;t a law against it, do it.
