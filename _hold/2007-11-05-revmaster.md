Got the revmaster this weekend! Now to finish outfitting it... On the shopping list:

* Pedals --- Turns out that look no longer makes Delta cleat pedals, so either need to go shopping on eBay or "upgrade" two bikes worth of pedals. The challenge with upgrading is what to get... so it's off to eBay. Some of the ideals:
  * Shimano PD-6620
  * Speedplay
  * Look Keo Sprint
  * Time --- I really like my ATACs. Kill review of the [Time RXS][1]
* Need the Pilot computer --- just need to determine if I need to replace the handlebars
* The missing bolt... Would you believe the person I bought it from didn't know which way lock nuts went on and lost one.
