Had this thought in the car the other day&#8230;  Given the copious lending strategies of our society, this might be a way to send your teen to school&#8230;

**Step 1:**

Go to the best school possible, try and finance 100% of their education with no cosigners.  This includes credit cards, housing etc.  Rack up as much debt as needed, but don&#8217;t acquire anything that would be considered an asset (e.g. a car).

**Step 2:**

Upon graduation and their first job, you should be (23..24) instead of starting payments on the $200,000 you owe, file them file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  You&#8217;ve now effective wiped the slate clean on $200,000 of debt.  You just graduated from school, you don&#8217;t have any assets worth anything&#8230;

**Step 3:**

After 7 years, the bankrupcy is totally gone from your credit report&#8230; You&#8217;re now 30, buying the house isn&#8217;t a big deal.   You&#8217;re probably married have a good income and you&#8217;ve got $200,000 (or more) in the bank since you didn&#8217;t have to repay those loans.
