I&#8217;m getting really frustrated at looking at site after site after site that really doesn&#8217;t solve your problem.&nbsp; I want products that make me smarter or reduce the amount of work I have to do!

My favorite whipping boy is groups, specifically Y!Groups or Google Groups, they&#8217;re products that are designed for &#8220;On the Internet nobody knows if you&#8217;re a dog.&#8221; mentality.&nbsp; Fundamentally 90% of the groups that I would actively participate in are &#8220;people I know.&#8221;

I have very simple requirements, it would probably only take a month to build out a whole service to do it all&#8230;&nbsp; Easily replace Y!Groups with it, but can I find a market, can I plug it into FB or some other thing that really makes people smarter?

Hmm&#8230;
