In the 80s we had MTV, a great distribution media for videos and creating a whole new set of artists.&nbsp; Of course we all know that MTV stop showing videos at some point and became a reality TV station&#8230;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve had Internet services from Napster to last.fm but I still think they&#8217;ve missed the mark.

There are a few forms of &#8220;listening to music&#8221;:

  * Totally passive &#8211; sitting at work with background music.  
    This can pretty much be satisfied with either a play list (if it&#8217;s personal) or my a radio station if it&#8217;s more broadcast.
  * Partial attention &#8211;&nbsp; this is where you care what&#8217;s in the play list.  
    Everything from a workout list, to wanting to have new artists introduced.
  * Community experience &#8211; what are my friends listening to.  
    This of course is the last.fm and the ilk place in the world.

The &#8220;great&#8221; part about a radio experience is that it&#8217;s simultaneous with everybody.&nbsp; Thus if you hear a great song you can call a friend and say &#8220;turn on the radio!&#8221;.&nbsp; With the Internet you should be able to listen to a &#8220;group radio&#8221; where 80% of the songs are shared between you and your friends.&nbsp; When you hear a song (or watch a video) you can comment right their (ala Mystery Science 3000).

If you say that you and you&#8217;re friends listen to different music, you&#8217;re clearly the wrong age!&nbsp; Think about how music is enjoyed by people < 20 &#8230; it&#8217;s a group experience a shared experience.
