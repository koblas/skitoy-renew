Just one of those moments&#8230; I&#8217;ve got a domain name that I need to figure out what to build on&#8230;&nbsp; [ICBM.NET][1] ideas so far:

  * Twitter clone with the ability to nuke somebody&#8230;
  * How about a hosting service with silos
  * Missile defense game&#8230;
  * Other ideas? Help&#8230;
