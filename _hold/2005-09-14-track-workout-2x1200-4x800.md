A good day at track, hard to belive... Rough stats:

Distance | Time
---------|-----
    1200 | 4:27
    1200 | 4:27
     800 | 3:07
     800 | 3:02
     400 | 1:30
     800 | 3:01

Ok, what's up with that 400 instead of an 800, and why 3:07
not another 3:01, it's all in the details. The targets for the
1200 were 4:41 so I knew I was going fast and the 800 were targeted at
3:06. But, I was feeling good on the 1200 so went for solid consistant
pace and then thought about trying for the 3:06 pace on the 800s...
In the end it felt better to go a bit faster, so I did.

Now about that 400 in the middle, when you have you kids at track things
happen&#8230; My daughter tripped and skinned her knee on the 400 so
I stopped did a litle basic eval of the situation. Settled her on the
bleachers with and did the last 800 to get things done.

...now about those 20 miles this weekend...
