Photo frame, or world interface.&nbsp; Caught this article about a [Digital picture frame doubles as a secondary display][1] and got to thinking about an old project.

**Idea:**

What I want is a useful device on my fridge to replace my calendar on the wall, see just about every sci-fi movie made in the last five years.&nbsp; But how?

How about a slave interface:

  * Digital picture frame at around 800&#215;600 
  * Shows photos when not &#8220;in use&#8221;
  * WiFi (ok, USB for now) connection to the home computer
  * Voice commands &#8212; think Star Trek &#8212; &#8220;Computer, show calendar&#8221;
  * That&#8217;s it, if it was really good you could say:&nbsp; &#8220;Computer, show grocery list, add milk&#8221;
  * When not in use show the slide show &#8212; maybe &#8220;improved&#8221; with the digital postcards&#8230;

Things that I continue to think about is how we interact with computers ala:

  * [Home Note][2] &#8212; Worth reading the papers to see what really happens&#8230;
  * [Digital Postcards][3] &#8212; think about what it would mean if there was a twitter-ish service that combined a fixed display in your home (office, etc) with the output of a cellphone camera from your friends..&nbsp; Take it one step further, Make those annoying facebook messages &#8220;real&#8221; by broadcasting them to passive viewers.&nbsp; [Ok, maybe you don&#8217;t want to tell your parents you woke up with somebody&#8230;]

Gosh, the whole Microsoft Socio-Digital Systems ****group looks fun&#8230;.&nbsp;
