After getting my butt in gear last night, went and did a 12m TT bike ride with Team Sheeper. The headwind was killer, but turned into a nice tailwind on the return 6m ride. Overall time was 36 minutes and had Derrick on my wheel for the last few miles to push me a bit harder.

Fun, always good to have a motivator.
