Pondering&#8230;

  If a tree falls in the woods any nobody is around, does it make a sound?

  If you blog something and nobody reads, is it written?
</center>

As I think about:

  * [Wink][1] &#8212; People search with feeds
  * [FriendFeed][2] &#8212; Just a feed stream (+ bookmarklet)&#8230; comments
  * [Plaxo][3] Pulse &#8212; they&#8217;re trying to prove with $XX million wasted that they can become facebook.

Are all ways to shared your feeds in new ways, but is there anybody in the woods.
