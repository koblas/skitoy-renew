Most of the time when you go out for a training class in the business world you typically have sessions that last 50 minutes then have a 10 minute &#8220;bio&#8221; break &#8212; Maybe they do one and half hour sessions with breaks. I&#8217;m doing a Children&#8217;s Specialist certification class for the next few weeks and I realized just how &#8220;odd&#8221; ski instructors are. Which after being a ski instructor isn&#8217;t that &#8220;odd&#8221;, but funny in comparison.

The general schedule is, arrive at 8:30 &#8220;clinic&#8221; until noon, eat lunch reviewing material, go back out on the hill until 3:30 and then summarize the lesson until 4:00. Sounds simple, but what you didn&#8217;t notice is that there was no &#8220;bio&#8221; break, no smoke break, no stopping. Ok, everybody gets a trip to the bathroom during lunch and we&#8217;re all adults so if you needed a stop you could. But, of course we&#8217;re all ski instructors so we don&#8217;t. This is the same schedule we do with classes &#8212; ok, the kids get many more &#8220;snack&#8221;/&#8221;bio&#8221; breaks, the instructors .. nope&#8230;

Just and interesting comparison.
