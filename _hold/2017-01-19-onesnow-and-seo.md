I've been working on an react-native application which has been a very interesting and fun learning project. While there are
always the challenges of getting a product built and ready, it's been a very interesting learning process about app stores
and releasing products.

The app [OneSnow](http://onesnow.com) is a tool to help Vail Resorts Instructors review their schedule, so it's not an app that will 
take over the world. 

## Google Play Store and SEO

The biggest challenge that I'm having is that the google play store isn't taking the product name as a searchable keyword. There are
a few ways to search the play store:

1. By Product name "OneSnow"
1. By ID: com.onesnow
1. By Developer: David Koblas

What's interesting is that #2 and #3 work just fine, but searching by "OneSnow" doesn't yield any results. They all yeild results, 
but #1 yeilds a generic result set that appear to be auto-correct at work since no result has "OneSnow" in the result name.

## So, why am I writing this?

Plain and simple, I need to get some SEO juice to the [OneSnow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onesnow) application,
since the more I can convince Google that this is a product name the better I'm doing. I also need to convince Google search that OneSnow is
a real word so it doesn't auto-correct it for general search.
