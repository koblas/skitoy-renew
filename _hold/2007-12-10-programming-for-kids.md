Just got done reading Jason Fry&#8217;s WSJ article about TV shows for kids, where he discusses Magic School Bus (From PET to Net).&nbsp; The really thought provoking part is his remising about the commodore PET.&nbsp; We all wrote programs like this when we were kids.

10 PRINT &#8216;JASON IS GREAT&#8217;  
20 GOTO 10  
RUN 

My personal favorite on the PET was ASCII art graphics to make rocket ships with flames (\*** patterns).&nbsp; 

The real thinking part is what about modern computers can make kids have the same sense of discovery that many of us had as kids&#8230;&nbsp; I worry that most kids would look at my ASCII art and wonder why it wasn&#8217;t as visually rich as their latest XBOX game.&nbsp; When kids are drawing pictures of things they go from crude to fairly refined over time (depending on talent/patience/etc..)&nbsp; Some of that is they start drawing from 2 years old and by the time they are able to think critically about their pictures they&#8217;ve already built the base talents.&nbsp; 

When it comes to computers&#8230;&nbsp; by the time you&#8217;ve already had a reasonable exposure to software to have higher expectations&#8230;&nbsp; So, how does one go about making software development fun for kids?&nbsp; 

Some of my random ideas:

* Break out the Apple ][+ from it&#8217;s storage and just let them play.&nbsp; The hard part is there is no community of other kids doing the same exploration. 
* Lego Mindstorms &#8212; it&#8217;s a cool platform.&nbsp; But, I have to wonder if the visual programming (data flow model) is just too abstract.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t have any problem with Muse software&#8217;s RobotWars as a kid.
* LOGO or BASIC &#8212; is there any good kid friendly versions of these left around?&nbsp; Visual basic is way too much for a seven year old.&nbsp; LOGO has the rapid discovery that&#8217;s interesting&#8230;
* [KPL][1], just discovered this from there website it feels like a&nbsp; modern approach to LOGO/BASIC.
* Of course there&#8217;s always the HTML/AJAX thought&#8230;&nbsp; It&#8217;s available it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s easy to show off.

Other ideas, or experiences&#8230;
