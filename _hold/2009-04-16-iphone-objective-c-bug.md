Funny bug from XCode and objective-c &#8230;

** warning: initialization from distinct Objective-C type **

For the following block of code:

```
// Quiz *qz = [[Quiz alloc] initFromDict: qdata];

Quiz *quiz = [Quiz alloc];

[quiz initFromDict: qdata];
```

From what I&#8217;ve read I ended up with the uncommented code as the operational code, since it implies that something bad will happen&#8230;Â  Before you ask &#8220;initFromDict&#8221; returns a (Quiz *) object..
