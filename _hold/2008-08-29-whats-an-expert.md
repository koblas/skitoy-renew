Found this on skidiva.com [Advanced or Expert &#8211; Not Sure][1], it&#8217;s worth considering for any pursuit &#8212; not just skiing.

If you kind of warily and timidly ski double-blacks &#8211; and only do so occasionally, then you are more likely advanced.

I think we can all agree that no one wants to be that person walking around bragging about how they&#8217;re an &#8220;expert skier&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s meaningless and sounds stupid. It&#8217;s like some guy in the bar who says they can ski &#8220;everything&#8221; at a big resort like Alta or Snowbird. Pfft &#8211; yeah right. There are plenty of lines with massive drops and crazy exposure that no one has been crazy enough to ski yet. Skiing the marked &#8220;trails&#8221; is only the beginning. So there&#8217;s no real reason to classify yourself for that purpose as far as I can tell. **<u>Whatever</u>** you&#8217;re doing is death defying in one person&#8217;s eyes and easy and boring to someone else.

And to be honest &#8211; those things all vary so widely there&#8217;s nothing even close to being a universal definition. Because they are all relative to the other people in the group or the other trails on the mountain. There is no universal definition for what a black or double black run is or how hard it is &#8211; and the same run can be easy in some conditions and impossible in others. Even when you try to say &#8211; well, I like steeps &#8211; even if you have your inclinometer out and can say &#8211; I skied a 50 degree slope &#8211; that&#8217;s great. But that could be very easy because it was short or had a nice open run out at the bottom or very difficult because it was tight/rocky/exposed.

If your friends are telling you you&#8217;re better than you think you are &#8211; listen to them when it comes to describing your skiing for an instructor or a guide. If you have to &#8211; say &#8220;I have a hard time saying it because I feel like I have so much room for improvement, but my friends all tell me that I&#8217;m an expert skier.&#8221; NO ONE who is trying to divide people into groups is expecting the definition of &#8220;expert&#8221; skiers to be perfection or anywhere near it. And Good Lord &#8211; if you walked into a ski shop and told the employees you&#8217;re anything other than an expert, they assume you need beginner gear. Because they&#8217;re without a doubt assuming that if you can make it down a black run alive, skis on or not, you&#8217;re calling yourself an expert.
