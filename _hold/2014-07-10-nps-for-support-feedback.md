Quick observation:

At the end of any support email thread NPS rank it.  NPS is based on the key question &#8220;How likely is it you would recommend us to a friend?&#8221;  However, when dealing with support it&#8217;s never a &#8220;recommend&#8221;.  Could the question be one of these:

* How satisfied were you with the handling of your issue?
* How likely would support be a reason for continuing to use our service?

Just thinking that I want to rate a current interaction with a company as a &#8220;5&#8221; &#8230;
