This idea came up in a conversation the other day with somebody&#8230; The crux of it is that more startups, toy websites or other research projects have been created over the years to aggregate blogs, twitters, lives into a single stream. Everything from facebook, friendfeed, google reader, netvibes, etc. Hey, even I wrote one (feedini.com &#8212; it&#8217;s probably not running at the moment).

The problem is that none of these experiences can compare to a newspaper in a few ways:

  * **Focus**
  
    We&#8217;ve all read and re-read the same story over 37 different blogs or news outlets, which gets to be a tedious pain.
  * **Breadth** 
  
    If I&#8217;m interested in &#8220;food&#8221; I&#8217;m interested in food, reading a single blog isn&#8217;t going to make me feel like I&#8217;m reading the food section of the newspaper.
  * **Diversity**
  
    I don&#8217;t read the sports section, but ever now and then I find that because it&#8217;s there I see something that&#8217;s worth reading.

This got me thinking, everybody has been trying to make a NLP/Machine learning system that creates the &#8220;right&#8221; content for you.  What happens if that&#8217;s the wrong idea!

My quick proposal, is that somebody should create an editors desk.  Think of it as bloglines meets about.com &#8212; I can create a personal newspaper that I can focus and drive anyway I want&#8230;.  Create editorial content or republish content quickly easily, etc.   With the added benefit that I could format it similar to a news site (rather than a blog).

This way my readership could look at a collection of stories that I was publishing &#8212; technically republishing (think AP wire).  I could establish the editorial voice of the site and have conversations/discussions that we close to the readership (think Hacker News).  Then make sure there is a solid set of editor tools &#8212; this is where my inner geek get off, this is where the NLP/Machine learning could help an editor focus in on important content to republish on their site.

Thus if you wanted to make a food portal you create &#8220;food.example.com&#8221; select a layout from the inventory &#8212; ala bloglines templates &#8212; then feed it a collection of interesting feeds and it would suggest a bunch more that were simlar&#8230; Walla you&#8217;re now 80% of the way to making and editorial portal.

Maybe it&#8217;s just democratizing Huffington Post&#8230;
