I like research!&nbsp; Reminds me of my days at NASA&#8230;&nbsp; Ok, it doesn&#8217;t help that I keep on seeing project that are planetary exploration (Google Earth, WorldWideTelescope) and have flashbacks to LOD determination and hierarchical rendering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, today&#8217;s computers can run circles around the Stellar computers of the time.

Notable things:

#### **WorldWide Telescope, HydroSeek**

It&#8217;s interesting to see how data normalization can really facilitate science.&nbsp; At the end of the day, while both of these tools are great at visualization what&#8217;s really interesting is that once you&#8217;ve normalized data formats you can do interesting things.&nbsp; My core thought from this was:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Data + Visualization = Exploration**

**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploration + Thinking = Science**

As in I can explore with WorldWide telescope for hours, which is a testament to Data + Visualization.&nbsp; But as soon as I start asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; I&#8217;m now doing science.&nbsp; 

#### **InkSeine**

Since I&#8217;ve got a tablet PC knocking around, it&#8217;s cool to see how &#8220;re-thinking&#8221; the UI for a tablet interface has such power.&nbsp; Now if the [Crayon Physics Deluxe][1] would release and take note of some of the UI bits that would be even better&#8230;&nbsp; Maybe a &#8220;Tablet&#8221; and a &#8220;Classic&#8221; operating modes.

#### **Botnet Detection**

Not as sexy as InkSeine, but good work.&nbsp; Think of it this way, if you see a group of users come in from a range of IP addresses you can assume they&#8217;re dynamically assigned since ISPs allocate a block of DHCP addresses to metro areas.&nbsp; If you and your neighbors all log in from the same general pool, they&#8217;re dynamic. 

Simple idea, probably loads of work to sift through the data, but nice&#8230;

Oh&#8230; why doesn&#8217;t Cisco or Company X get caught as dynamic&#8230; well, you&#8217;re pretty much NATed to one IP address not a whole range of IP addresses.
