A few years ago I spent a winter taking EMT classes to become an EMT&#8230;&nbsp; One idea at the time was to hang out being ski patrol, but the hours that ski patrol works is not &#8220;family friendly&#8221;.&nbsp; Getting out to the mountain way early to help setup and then late to help take down, it might have been fun, but not something that fits life at the moment.

Now we&#8217;re into the 2007-2008 ski season and I&#8217;m going to do something a little more family friendly&#8230; Ski instruction.&nbsp; The first step of course is getting attached to a mountain such that I can take all of the PSIA courses.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how I just spent the last four days of last week.

Day 1 &#8211; 12:00 &#8211; 3:00 &#8211; Information overload, group of about 40 people sitting down to orientation and getting some general background.&nbsp; Then it&#8217;s off to learn the basic procedures for the children&#8217;s center.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 4:00 to 7:00 it was a general mountain orientation from HR (e.g. the CYA talk about harassment, discrimination, etc, etc.)

Day 2 &#8211; 9:00 &#8211; 4:00 &#8211; one full workday&#8230;&nbsp; Huge amount of detail about how the children center operates, from the three year old room, the 4-6 year olds and the 7-12 year olds.&nbsp; All good, but somewhere during the day my head exploded and much of the information started drifting out, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes on the first few days.

Day 3 &#8211; 9:00 &#8211; 4:00 &#8211; finally got to bring our skis to the mountain!&nbsp;&nbsp; This was probably the best day, not only did we get a few fun runs in but the content was focused on &#8220;how a beginner sees the hill&#8221;.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty amazing how your perspective changes as you&#8217;re skill improves.&nbsp; Covered alot about adults and kids and how to teach them.

Day 4 &#8211; 9:30 &#8211; 4:00 &#8211; Shadowing&#8230; spent the day with a group of 4-6 year olds (level 2 skiers).&nbsp; This really help re-enforce the bits that were learned on day 3, also got a change to talk about a whole bunch of details..
